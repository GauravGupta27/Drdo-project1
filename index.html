    DRDO while striving to meet the Cutting edge weapons technology requirements provides ample spinoff benefits to the society

    <br>
    <br>
    We receive innumerous requests in connection with the summer internship/industrial training/project work in our organization
    i.e. DRDO. We are happy to know about enthusiasm of students to do their training in the organization. 
    However, we would like to make you aware that DRDO comprises different laboratories spread across the country, 
    the detailed addresses of which are available in DRDO website.
    <br>
    <br>
   Each laboratory has a different field of research, development and core competence 
   like armaments, materials, electronics, heavy vehicles, missiles, life sciences etc. 
   about which you can get an overview from the website. As these are a cluster of laboratories 
   under the aegis of Ministry of Defence, each has different training policies based on their security restrictions. 
   The Director of the concerned lab is the only approving authority for such type of industrial trainings. 
   We therefore suggest that you should directly contact the Director of the concerned lab in which you desire 
   to get your training through the Head of your College/Institute. Any further clarifications regarding the 
   training process and policies may also be obtained from the concerned lab in which you desire to have your training from.
